# Session 2 (Thursday, July 2, 2015)

Today, we're going to be getting practice with using `git`, `HTML`, `CSS` and learning terminal.

## Objectives

- Learn Chrome Dev Tools (Inspector)
- Basic Terminal Commands
- Using `git`
- Browser Differences & CSS Resets (Normalize)

## Homework

- Create a *.github.io repository in [github.com](http://www.github.com)
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Create a new `index.html` and `style.css` in the directory
- The HTML file should have the follow semantically correct, hierarchically correct information:
    - Your name
    - Your github username (with a link to your personal github url)
    - Your Location
    - Your Personal website (if you have one)
    - At minimum 3 paragraph bio
    - A list of your github repositories with links to the repositories
    - A list of your 3 favorite foods with your absolute favorite at the top and least absolute favorite at the bottom
    - Your 3 favorite musical artists, the favorite album of that artist and the genre of the artist (I'm going to let you decide how to output this)

- Use normalize css to make your experience consistent for users
- Emulate the "styles" of github.com. (hint: use Chrome DevTools), this will include styling for things like:
    - anchors (links)
    - headings
    - lists
